# Automation

As part of the operations side of my DEVOPS work, I work a lot towards automating what I can from a sysadmin perspective. Having a background in Six Sigma and automation engineering, I'm always scoping out oppertunities to automate my team's workload. 

That being said, I'm always cognizant of security and general best practices, so we unfortunately cant automate everything even though the capability exists. 

This folder contains the powershell scripts I use to automate mine and my team's day to day Operations.
